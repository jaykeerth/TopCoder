Problem Statement 

     
You are given a collection of points in the plane, with x[i] and y[i] representing the i-th point. Return the number of triangles that can be formed using three of the points as vertices.
 

Definition 

     
Class: PointsInAPlane 
Method: howManyTriangles 
Parameters: int[], int[] 
Returns: int 
Method signature: int howManyTriangles(int[] x, int[] y) 
(be sure your method is public) 
 

Limits 

     
Time limit (s): 2.000 
Memory limit (MB): 256 
 

Notes 

- Three points can only form a triangle if they are not colinear. 

Constraints 

- x will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive. 
- y will contain the same number of elements as x. 
- Each element of x will be between -1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000, inclusive. 
- Each element of y will be between -1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000, inclusive. 
- No two points will be at the same position. 

Examples 

0)  
     

{0, 1, 2}
 
{0, 1, 0}
 
 
Returns: 1
 

These three points for a triangle. 
 
 
1)  
     

{0, 1, 2}
 
{0, 0, 0}
 
 
Returns: 0
 

These three points sit along the x-axis, and are all collinear. 
 
 
2)  
     

{0, 1, 2, 3}
 
{0, 2, 1, 3}
 
 
Returns: 4
 

Pick any three points, and they form a triangle. 
 
 
3)  
     

{0, 1, 2, 1}
 
{0, 0, 0, 1}
 
 
Returns: 3
